Problem: Testing methods named DataWranglerTest1(), DataWranglerTest2(), and DataWranglerTest3() in DictionaryTests.java have errors. 
Result: The whole application (including test and makefile) does not compiled and run at all.
Solution: Delete the three tests methods (DataWranglerTest1(), DataWranglerTest2(), and DataWranglerTest3()) or make them as comments in the DictionaryTests.java file. It will make the file successfully run and compiled.  

Comments to grader: Thank you so much for your consideration again.
